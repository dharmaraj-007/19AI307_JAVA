# Ex.No:1(D) USER DEFINED METHOD.

## AIM:
To write a Java program to calculate and print the area of a square using an instance method named calculateArea() inside a class named Area. The program should use a local variable for calculation, and the method should have a void return type.

## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.  
2.Define a class named Area.   
3.Inside the class, define an instance method named calculateArea().  
4.In this method:  
Use a Scanner to take user input for the side of the square.  
5.Declare a local variable to store the side length.   
6.Calculate the area using the formula area = side Ã— side.   
7.Print the area.   
8.In the main method:  
9.Create an object of class Area.   
10.Call the calculateArea() method using the object.   
11.End the program.

## Sourcecode.java:
```
import java.util.*;
public class Area {
        void calculateArea()
    {
        double side,cirarea;
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        side=sc.nextDouble();
        cirarea=side*side;
        System.out.println("Area of Square is "+cirarea);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Area obj=new Area();
        obj.calculateArea();
    }
    
}
