# Ex.No:1(E)  STATIC VARIABLE

## AIM:
Write a program to multiply 80 to the number then divide it by 5  and subtract 15 . Display the final result.

## ALGORITHM :
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare an integer variable num and assign it the value 500

Step 3: Multiply num by 80 and store the result
    product = num * 80

Step 4: Divide product by 5 and store the result
    quotient = product / 5

Step 5: Subtract 15 from quotient and store the result in result
    result = quotient - 15

Step 6: Display the value of result

Step 7: End

## Sourcecode.java:
```
public class Demo
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num=500,mul,div,res;
        mul=num*80;
        div=mul/5;
        res=div-15;
        System.out.println(res);
    }
}

## RESULT:
Thus, the Java program for the concept of using a static variable for shared data was correctly implemented and verified successfully.
